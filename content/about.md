## üßë‚Äçüíº Experience

### Product Development Intern
*Adobe ‚Ä¢ May 2024 ‚Äì Jul 2024*
- Designed and implemented a REST API using the *Apache Sling framework* and Java to generate *AI-driven content suggestions* for DITA documents stored in a Java Content Repository.
- Built a full-stack web application leveraging JUI-Spectrum, *React*, and *TypeScript* to integrate the API and display smart suggestions and reports for DITA documents.


### Researcher
*Networks and Security Lab, IIIT Delhi ‚Ä¢ Jan 2023 ‚Äì Jun 2025*  
- Developed an *Internet shutdown circumvention* system leveraging the *VoLTE* channel to provide Internet service in censored
regions.
- Implemented an *SDN-based architecture* that utilizes *Smart NICs* (programmable network cards) to address issues with *Decoy Routing* (an Internet censorship circumvention approach).

## üìÇ Projects

### [Divya Drishti](https://github.com/skyscrappers/DivyaDrishti.git)  
- Developed an AI-powered assistive solution for visually impaired individuals at IIIT Delhi, utilizing Computer Vision, NLP and LLAMA 3.2.
- Implemented features including Visual Question Answering, 88% accurate real-time obstacle detection, a voice-based agent for sending and receiving emails, and a SQL agent for querying the ERP Portal of IIIT Delhi.

### [Ratchet Chat](https://github.com/prateek21081/ratchet-chat.git)  
- Implemented a secure communication application using the Double Ratchet algorithm (Signal protocol) in Python, leveraging the Cryptography library for cryptographic operations.
- The application achieves end-to-end encryption, safeguarding the privacy of messages exchanged between parties. To facilitate real-time communication, the system integrates Remote Procedure Call (RPC) as a lightweight and efficient messaging mechanism.

### [Textual Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction in Conversations](https://github.com/manavmittal05/Emotion-Cause-Analysis-in-Conversations.git)
- Created model for Emotion recognition and cause pair identification in conversations with macro F1 scores of 0.6 and 0.49 respectively.
- Utilized sentence transformer, LSTM, and CNN for emotion recognition, BERT transformer and Attention Mechanism to identify text spans triggering emotions on a dataset of 1374 conversations.

### [KYC Website](https://github.com/manavmittal05/KYC-Website.git)
- Developed a full-stack web application using Node.js, FastAPI, MongoDB, and Python to provide KYC services, including user detail verification and facial recognition matching with ID documents.
- Deployed the web application on Amazon EC2 and the machine learning API on Oracle EC2 for seamless scalability and performance.
